## 1. Core Building Mechanics

### 1.1 Universal Construction Framework

• **Action-Based Construction**
  Each section of the building requires a certain number of actions per square meter, factoring in material and complexity. Higher-level skills or specialized help can reduce the required actions.

• **Resource Requirements**
  Building size, quality, and the desired features all determine the amount (and type) of materials needed (wood, stone, metal, magical essences, etc.).

• **Skill Checks**
  #### Standard Mode
  Architecture, Carpentry, Masonry, and related skills influence both the time required and the final quality tier. Simple success/failure checks for most construction, with narrative-driven outcomes. Players can describe their approach to gain advantage on checks.

  #### Hard Mode
  Strict DC thresholds for each construction stage:
  - Foundation work: DC 12-18 depending on terrain
  - Wall construction: DC 14-20 based on height and material
  - Specialty rooms: DC 16-25 for magical or complex functions
  - Critical failure on Natural 1: Partial collapse, material waste, or structural flaw
  - Critical success on Natural 20: Unexpected quality improvement, material savings, or time reduction

• **Assistance Multipliers**
  Hired labor, magical constructs, and companion assistance can drastically reduce build time or improve quality. Each helper with relevant skills acts as a multiplier on the base action rate.

• **Quality Tiers**
  Buildings follow a scale (Crude → Standard → Quality → Superior → Masterwork → Legendary), affecting durability, appearance, and any mechanical bonuses (e.g., defense or crafting benefits inside).

• **Environment Modifiers**
  Construction difficulty adjusts based on terrain. Urban zones may require permits and compliance with local building codes, whereas wild areas require extra effort for clearing land and accessing resources.

• **Risk vs. Reward Options**
  #### Standard Mode
  Players can choose to take creative approaches with minimal mechanical penalties.

  #### Hard Mode
  - Optional "rushed construction" at +5 DC but 30% time reduction
  - "Careful building" at -5 DC but 50% more time required
  - "Experimental techniques" with high risk/reward outcomes

### 1.2 Environment-Specific Mechanics

#### Urban Construction

• **Permit System**
  Most towns and cities mandate building permits. Factions or guilds might require fees or limit building size. Some areas have style guidelines or zoning laws.

• **Space Limitations**
  Building footprints are constrained by neighboring structures. Vertical expansion can mitigate limited land.

• **Building Codes**
  Areas of wealth or specialized districts (Magic Quarter, Merchant Quarter) have unique architectural demands.

• **Neighbor Relations**
  Massive or noisy projects can strain NPC relationships. Diplomacy and bribes may be needed to keep the peace.

• **Utility Access**
  Tapping into existing water, sewage, or mechanical/magical conduits can speed building but may cost additional fees.

#### Wilderness Construction

• **Land Claiming**
  You must secure rights (or simply stake a claim) in remote regions. Factions or monster threats may contest your presence.

• **Resource Proximity**
  Transporting materials to remote locations increases cost or requires players to gather local resources.

• **Environmental Challenges**
  Extreme weather, predators, or magical anomalies can slow or damage construction. Defensive measures may be required at each step.

• **Self-Sufficiency Systems**
  Water collection, refuse disposal, and power generation (e.g., mills, mana crystals) are vital in rugged areas.

• **Concealment Options**
  You can blend the structure with surroundings to avoid detection, especially important for hidden bases or outposts.

#### Underground/Cave Construction

• **Structural Integrity**
  Excavation demands additional bracing and skill checks. Collapses can be fatal.

• **Ventilation**
  Fresh air is crucial for subterranean living. Herbal or magical solutions may purify stagnant air.

• **Lighting**
  Plan for natural light shafts, lanterns, or luminous crystals.

• **Water Management**
  Seepage and flooding are major risks. Drains or magical wards might be necessary.

• **Expansion Techniques**
  Carving out new chambers has extra steps: surveying rock hardness, disposing of rubble, ensuring safe expansions.

#### Aquatic Construction

• **Foundation Types**
  Options include floating rafts, stilted platforms, or fully submerged domes.

• **Waterproofing**
  Materials and sealants must handle constant exposure to water. Enchanted materials can prevent rot or corrosion.

• **Current/Tide Management**
  Ensuring your structure endures waves or tides may require specialized engineering or spells.

• **Docking Facilities**
  For boats, ships, or aquatic creatures.

• **Specialized Materials**
  Water-repellent wood, corrosion-resistant metals, or magical bubble barriers are key.

### 1.3 Construction Methods

#### Physical Labor

• **Personal Construction**
  The player invests daily actions with skill checks. Slower but cheaper if you have time and skill.

• **Hired Labor**
  Paying NPCs with specific trade skills can expedite building or raise quality. Costs vary by region and complexity.

• **Community Effort**
  Aligning with certain factions or towns might let you rally volunteers (temple faithful, guild members).

• **Master Builders**
  Proficient architects or engineers can add large quality bonuses or unique design features (like hidden rooms).

#### Magical Construction

• **Conjuration Magic**
  Summon intangible or semi-intangible building blocks. Typically quick but requires powerful spells or mana costs.

• **Element Manipulation**
  Shape elements (earth, wood, stone) into desired forms. Skilled mages can significantly reduce material needs.

• **Golem Workers**
  Summoned/constructed creatures handle the brute force. Requires control spells or special crystals to direct them.

• **Spatial Manipulation**
  Enlarge interior spaces beyond external dimensions (bag-of-holding style rooms).

• **Reality Anchoring**
  Permanent wards to ensure magically shaped structures don’t collapse under normal physics.

#### Technological Methods (If Setting Allows)

• **Construction Tools**
  Cranes, pulleys, or advanced machinery reduce labor costs. Maintenance or fuel may be needed.

• **Prefabrication**
  Build modules off-site and transport for quick assembly.

• **Mechanical Assistance**
  Clockwork or steam-powered devices for heavy lifting.

• **Advanced Materials**
  Reinforced steel, tech-based illusions, or alternative energy systems.
