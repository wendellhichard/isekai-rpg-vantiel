## 2. Core Dice Mechanics

### 2.1 Basic Roll Structure

The fundamental structure of dice rolls in Vantiel follows a consistent pattern:

#### Standard Roll Format
- **Base Formula**: d20 + Modifiers vs. Difficulty Class (DC)
- **Success Condition**: Roll result equals or exceeds the DC
- **Failure Condition**: Roll result is less than the DC
- **Roll Notation**: Uses standard dice notation (e.g., d20, 2d6, 3d8)
- **Modifier Application**: All applicable modifiers are added to the die result

#### Roll Types
- **Standard Roll**: A single d20 roll with normal probability distribution
- **Advantage Roll**: Roll 2d20 and take the higher result (favorable circumstances)
- **Disadvantage Roll**: Roll 2d20 and take the lower result (unfavorable circumstances)
- **Flat Roll**: A roll without modifiers, used in special circumstances
- **Open Roll**: A roll where results are visible to all participants
- **Hidden Roll**: A roll where results are known only to the Game Master

#### Dice Varieties
- **d20**: Primary die for skill checks, attacks, and most action resolutions
- **d12**: Used for certain weapon damage and special abilities
- **d10**: Used for percentile rolls (d100) and certain damage types
- **d8**: Common for weapon damage and effect durations
- **d6**: Used for common damage, random tables, and many effects
- **d4**: Used for small weapon damage and minor effects
- **d100**: Percentile dice (2d10) for random tables and probability checks

### 2.2 Difficulty Classes (DC)

Difficulty Classes represent the challenge level of tasks and obstacles:

#### Standard DC Scale
| Difficulty | DC | Description |
|------------|----:|-------------|
| Trivial | 5 | Tasks so easy that most people succeed automatically |
| Easy | 10 | Tasks that untrained individuals can accomplish with some effort |
| Moderate | 15 | Tasks requiring training or talent to reliably accomplish |
| Challenging | 20 | Tasks that test the limits of trained individuals |
| Difficult | 25 | Tasks that only experts can reliably accomplish |
| Very Difficult | 30 | Tasks at the limit of human capability |
| Nearly Impossible | 35+ | Tasks beyond normal human limits, requiring exceptional circumstances |

#### DC Determination Factors
- **Inherent Difficulty**: The base challenge of the task itself
- **Circumstantial Factors**: Environmental conditions affecting the task
- **Time Pressure**: Urgency that may increase difficulty
- **Resource Limitations**: Restricted tools or materials
- **Consequences of Failure**: Higher stakes may increase difficulty

#### Special DC Types
- **Opposed DC**: Set by an opponent's roll or static value
- **Hidden DC**: Unknown to players until after the roll
- **Tiered DC**: Different levels of success based on how much the roll exceeds the base DC
- **Progressive DC**: Increasing difficulty for repeated attempts
- **Compound DC**: Requiring multiple successful rolls for complete success

### 2.3 Modifiers

Modifiers adjust dice rolls to reflect character capabilities, circumstances, and other factors:

#### Character-Based Modifiers
- **Attribute Modifiers**: Bonuses from primary character statistics
- **Skill Ranks**: Bonuses from trained skills
- **Class Abilities**: Bonuses from class features and specializations
- **Equipment Bonuses**: Advantages from tools, weapons, and gear
- **Experience Bonuses**: Advantages from having performed similar tasks before

#### Circumstantial Modifiers
- **Environmental Factors**: Weather, terrain, lighting conditions
- **Preparation**: Benefits from planning and setup
- **Assistance**: Help from allies or tools
- **Impairments**: Injuries, exhaustion, or distractions
- **Tactical Advantages**: Positioning, timing, or strategic benefits

#### Stacking Rules
- **Same-Type Modifiers**: Generally don't stack; use only the highest
- **Different-Type Modifiers**: Stack with each other
- **Temporary Modifiers**: Duration-limited bonuses or penalties
- **Conditional Modifiers**: Apply only in specific circumstances
- **Scaling Modifiers**: Change based on degree of advantage/disadvantage

#### Modifier Limits
- **Maximum Modifier**: Total modifiers cannot exceed +20
- **Minimum Result**: A natural roll of 1 always fails regardless of modifiers
- **Maximum Result**: A natural roll of 20 always succeeds regardless of modifiers
- **Cancellation**: Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out
- **Diminishing Returns**: Multiple sources of the same modifier type have reduced effect

#### Hard Mode Modifier Adjustments
- **Stricter Limits**: Maximum positive modifiers reduced to +15
- **Harsher Penalties**: Negative modifiers apply at 1.5Ã— their normal value
- **Extended Failure Range**: Natural rolls of 1-3 count as critical failures
- **Reduced Critical Success**: Only natural 20s count as critical successes
- **Compounding Failures**: Failed checks may apply penalties to subsequent related checks

### 2.4 Critical Results

Critical results represent exceptionally good or bad outcomes:

#### Critical Success
- **Trigger**: Natural roll of 20 on d20
- **Effect**: Exceptional success beyond normal parameters
- **Combat Application**: Doubled damage dice on attacks
- **Skill Application**: Additional benefits beyond basic success
- **Special Abilities**: May modify critical success conditions or effects
- **Narrative Impact**: Described with special cinematic flair and lasting effects

#### Critical Failure
- **Trigger**: Natural roll of 1 on d20 (or 1-3 in Hard Mode)
- **Effect**: Exceptional failure with additional negative consequences
- **Combat Application**: Weapon fumble, loss of balance, or self-injury
- **Skill Application**: Complications or setbacks beyond basic failure
- **Recovery Options**: Methods to mitigate critical failure effects
- **Narrative Consequence**: Creates meaningful story complications or character development

#### Extended Critical Range
- **Expanded Success Range**: Some abilities allow critical success on 19-20 or even 18-20
- **Expanded Failure Range**: Some challenging situations expand failure range to 1-2
- **Confirmation Rolls**: Secondary roll to confirm critical results in some situations
- **Critical Specialization**: Class abilities that enhance critical effects
- **Critical Resistance**: Abilities or circumstances that reduce critical vulnerability

#### Graduated Success/Failure System

To create more nuanced outcomes, the dice system employs graduated results:

| Roll Type | Outcome | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Natural 20 (Critical Success) | Exceptional Success | Far exceeds expectations with additional benefits |
| Beat DC by 10+ | Outstanding Success | Achieves goal with significant additional advantages |
| Beat DC by 5-9 | Strong Success | Accomplishes task with minor additional benefits |
| Beat DC by 1-4 | Basic Success | Just accomplishes the intended goal |
| Miss DC by 1-4 | Minor Failure | Just falls short, with option to recover |
| Miss DC by 5-9 | Clear Failure | Definitely fails but without disaster |
| Miss DC by 10+ | Major Failure | Fails with additional complications |
| Natural 1 (Critical Failure) | Catastrophic Failure | Worst possible outcome with lasting consequences |

**Hard Mode Adjustment:** In Hard Mode, the success thresholds increase by +5 DC, and critical failure range expands to natural 1-3 on the dice.

```

### 9.1 Failure Philosophy

The dice system is designed to create failures that:

- **Advance the Narrative**: Failures push the story in new directions rather than stalling it
- **Reveal Character**: How characters respond to failure reveals their true nature
- **Create Tension**: Moments of failure build dramatic tension and investment
- **Teach and Guide**: Failures provide information about better approaches
- **Feel Fair**: Even when outcomes are negative, they should feel like reasonable consequences

### 9.2 Hard Mode Implementation

Hard Mode enforces a stricter and more realistic approach to the dice system:

- **Mandatory Rolls**: All significant actions require explicit dice rolls
- **Stricter DCs**: Base difficulty class values increase by +5 across the board
- **Expanded Critical Failure**: Natural rolls of 1-3 count as critical failures
- **Resource Management**: Stamina, item durability, and other resources deplete more quickly
- **Injury Persistence**: Wounds inflict ongoing penalties until properly treated
- **Realistic Limitations**: Physical and mental limitations are strictly enforced
- **Compounding Failures**: Failed checks in sequence become progressively more difficult

### 9.3 Game Master Guidelines

When determining failure through dice:

1. **Consider Context Fully**: Weigh all relevant factors before setting DC
2. **Offer Graduated Consequences**: Match the severity of failure to the die result
3. **Provide Recovery Paths**: Almost every failure should have some recovery option
4. **Make It Interesting**: Failures should never be mere obstacles but story opportunities
5. **Maintain Internal Logic**: Failures should make sense within the world's rules
6. **Balance Challenge**: Adjust failure frequency based on story pacing and tension
7. **Remember Character Growth**: A character's history with similar tasks affects failure chances

### 9.4 Context-Based Failure Determination

The Narrative Tension System considers numerous factors when determining if an action fails:

- **Character Skill Level**: Higher skill reduces but doesn't eliminate failure chance
- **Previous Success Streak**: A series of successes increases failure probability
- **Environmental Conditions**: Weather, terrain, and other external factors
- **Physical/Mental State**: Injury, fatigue, stress, and other internal conditions
- **Preparation Quality**: Research, planning, and proper equipment
- **Narrative Importance**: How central the action is to the current storyline
- **Hard Mode Status**: Whether strict realism is being enforced

**Example Assessment:**
```
[Lockpicking Assessment - Hidden]
â€¢ Character Skill: Expert thief (+)
â€¢ Previous Success: Four consecutive successful lockpicks (-)
â€¢ Environmental: Dark night, rain-slicked fingers (-)
â€¢ Physical State: Slightly injured shoulder from earlier fall (-)
â€¢ Preparation: Has proper tools, studied lock beforehand (+)
â€¢ Narrative Importance: Critical story path (+)
â€¢ Hard Mode: Not active
â€¢ Net Assessment: Moderate failure chance (35%)

[Result]
Your lockpicks slide into the mechanism with practiced ease, but as you apply pressure to the final tumbler, your injured shoulder twinges unexpectedly. Your hand jerks slightly, and you feel one of your delicate picks bend. The lock is still functional, but this particular pick is now useless, and you'll need to start the process over with a different tool.
```

### 9.5 Meaningful Recovery Options

The system ensures that failures provide interesting recovery paths:

- **Second Attempts**: Often allowed with penalty or resource cost
- **Alternative Methods**: Different approaches that bypass the original challenge
- **Assistant Options**: Ways that allies or NPCs can help overcome failure
- **Resource Solutions**: Items or energy that can be expended to succeed despite failure
- **Narrative Workarounds**: Story-based solutions that emerge from the failure itself

**Example Recovery:**
```
[Failed Athletics Check to Climb Wall]

The stone wall proves more challenging than you anticipated. Halfway up, your foot slips on a loose stone, and you slide painfully back to the ground, scraping your hands in the process.

Recovery Options:
1. Try again with a higher DC and minor injury penalty
2. Look for a different entry point (alternate path)
3. Use rope and grappling hook from inventory (resource solution)
4. Ask your companion for assistance (assistance option)
5. Wait for the guard patrol to change and try the gate instead (narrative workaround)
```

## 10. Conclusion

The dice system serves as the foundation for resolving uncertainty in Vantiel, providing a balanced framework that combines skill, circumstance, and chance. By integrating with all other systems and maintaining narrative immersion, it creates a cohesive experience where every roll tells a story and shapes the world in meaningful ways.

Remember that in Vantiel, dice rolls are not merely mechanical abstractions but representations of the world's inherent unpredictabilityâ€”a concept understood by all its inhabitants. From the humblest farmer to the mightiest warrior, everyone in Vantiel recognizes that while skill and preparation improve one's chances, fate always has the final say.
