## 6. Social Dynamics

### 6.1 Guild Politics

The internal power structures and decision-making processes:

**Now references Cognitive Bias, Reflection, and Narrative Drift (see below) for deeper realism in leadership decisions, member disputes, and guild culture. Guildmasters and members may reflect incorrectly or unpredictably due to trauma, bias, or memory fracture, and narrative drift can affect guild policies, quest boards, and internal factions.**

#### Political Structures
- **Formal Hierarchy**: Official chain of command
- **Informal Influence**: Unofficial power networks

- **Term Limitations**: Restrictions on leadership duration

#### Power Dynamics

### Cognitive Bias, Reflection, and Narrative Drift in Guild Operations

Guild leadership, member interactions, and quest boards are now influenced by advanced narrative and psychological systems:

#### Guild Cognitive Bias & Trauma Table

| Bias/Trauma Example         | How It Affects Guild Decisions/Reflection                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tradition Fixation          | Resists new quest types, slow to adopt reforms                |
| Meritocratic Elitism        | Dismisses low-rank member input, favors "proven" voices       |
| Scandal Trauma              | Overreacts to rumors, suppresses dissent                      |
| Hero Worship                | Ignores flaws in high-rank members, scapegoats outsiders      |
| Factional Paranoia          | Sees conspiracies in routine events, restricts information    |
| Burnout/Disaster Memory     | Avoids high-risk quests, overregulates after past failures    |

*GM/AI should select or roll for a bias/trauma when resolving guild disputes, policy debates, or leadership reflection, especially in times of crisis or change.*

#### Reflection, Memory Fracture, and Narrative Drift

- Leadership and member decisions may be based on incomplete, biased, or fractured memories (e.g., after magical events, trauma, or rumor cascades).
- Reflection on past events can be delayed, incorrect, or emotionally charged, leading to policy reversals, apologies, or schisms.
- Narrative drift: repeated member behaviors, viral rumors, or ideological memes can reshape guild culture, quest board content, or even create cults/factions within the guild.
- Censorship: certain quest types, topics, or member actions may be suppressed, triggering resistance or underground movements.

#### Viral Belief, Censorship, and Addictive Ideology

- Guilds may develop viral beliefs (e.g., "The Guild never abandons its own") that spread through rumor, ritual, or member stories.
- Addictive ideologies can take hold, leading to withdrawal arcs, belief collapse, or enlightenment events (e.g., a "Glory at Any Cost" cult forms, then fractures after a disaster).
- Censorship of certain ideas or quest types can create resistance, secret societies, or alternative quest boards.

#### GM/AI Prompts for Guild Reflection & Drift

When handling guild operations, ask:
1. What cognitive bias or trauma colors this decision or policy?
2. Has memory fracture or rumor drift altered the guild's perception of events?
3. Are viral beliefs or addictive ideologies shaping member behavior or quest selection?
4. Is censorship or resistance emerging in response to new ideas or failures?
5. How does reflection (correct or incorrect) change the outcome of disputes, promotions, or reforms?

These mechanics ensure the Adventurers Guild is a living, evolving organization, capable of both wisdom and folly, and deeply affected by the psychological and narrative forces at play in Vantiel.
