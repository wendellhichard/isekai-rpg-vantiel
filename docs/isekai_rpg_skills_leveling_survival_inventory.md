## 1.0 Overview

In Vantiel, skills and abilities define how characters interact with the world, overcome challenges, and grow throughout their journey. This system governs the acquisition, development, and mastery of various capabilities, from basic combat techniques to legendary magical powers.

Every skill has a rank and level that determine its power and potential. As characters gain experience and face challenges, their abilities evolve, sometimes transforming into entirely new powers. Special abilities like Thread-Sight and the Great Sage provide unique advantages and narrative opportunities, while the mysterious Forbidden Fruits offer rare and powerful skills with significant consequences.

## 1.0 Overview

Predator is an S-Rank unique skill that embodies the primal concept of "you are what you eat" taken to its logical extreme. It allows the wielder to consume defeated enemies and assimilate their abilities, knowledge, and—for those with compatible physiology like slimes or certain shapeshifters—even their physical form. This extraordinarily rare and feared ability transforms its users into apex predators capable of endless evolution through consumption.

Born from the chaotic energies of the Fracture or perhaps a forbidden experiment lost to time, Predator exists at the intersection of divine and profane magic. The Radiant Covenant considers it an abomination to be purged, while those seeking power view it as the ultimate path to unlimited potential.

## 2.0 Core Mechanics

### 2.1 Skill Classification

**Rank:** S-Rank (Divine)
**Type:** Unique Skill (Cannot be taught or transferred)
**Magic System Alignment:** Primarily Profane with elements of Arcane
**Detection:** Radiates a distinctive aura detectable by high-level divine magic

### 2.2 Acquisition Methods

Predator cannot be learned through conventional means. Known paths to acquisition include:

- Consuming an extremely rare variant of Forbidden Fruit (1 in 10,000 chance)
- Receiving a blessing from an ancient, forgotten deity of consumption
- Undergoing a rare mutation triggered by consuming large quantities of magically-saturated monster cores
- Reincarnation boon for souls with specific traits or past-life abilities
- Being born as certain rare monster species (some slimes, mimics, or doppelgangers)

### 2.3 Consumption Process

```mermaid

    A[Target Defeat] --> B[Physical Consumption]
    B --> C[Digestion Period]
    C --> D[Skill Analysis]
    D --> E[Skill Integration]
    E --> F[Skill Mastery]
```

**Target Selection:**
- Entity must be organic or have an organic component
- Target typically needs to be defeated, incapacitated, or willing
- Living consumption is possible but substantially more difficult
- Higher-ranked entities require more advanced Predator skill levels

**Consumption Requirements:**
- Physical ingestion of at least part of the target
- Significant tissue samples required for skill acquisition
- Complete consumption necessary for full mimicry
- Magicule-rich organs (cores, hearts) provide optimal results

**Digestion Period:**
- Time required to break down and analyze consumed material
- Duration varies based on:
  - Predator skill level
  - Target complexity
  - Skill compatibility
  - Quantity consumed
- During digestion, partial skills may manifest unpredictably

**Integration Process:**
- Skills are decoded and transformed to match user's magicule structure
- Compatibility determined based on user attributes and existing skills
- Integration feelings range from pleasant tingling to intense pain
- Voice of the World announces significant skill acquisitions

## 3.0 Skill Progression

### 3.1 Mastery Levels

**Novice (Level 1-3): Primitive Consumption**
- Consumption limited to small creatures (up to dog-sized)
- 1-3 skills can be retained simultaneously
- Physical mimicry is imperfect and temporary (4-12 hours)
- Long digestion period (1-3 days per significant skill)
- Skills limited to F-rank and E-rank
- Often experience uncontrolled manifestations of consumed abilities
- Limited control over transformation process
- Strong taste aversion remains (consumption feels unnatural)

**Adept (Level 4-6): Advanced Predation**
- Can consume human-sized entities
- 5-8 skills can be retained simultaneously
- Physical mimicry more accurate with longer duration (1-3 days)
- Voice and basic mannerisms can be mimicked
- Moderate digestion period (12-24 hours)
- Can acquire and utilize D-rank and C-rank skills
- Better control over skill activation and deactivation
- Decreased taste aversion (consumption feels less unnatural)
- Begin developing a "hunger" for specific powerful abilities

**Expert (Level 7-9): Superior Consumption**
- Can consume larger creatures (up to ogre-sized)
- 10-15 skills can be retained simultaneously
- Nearly perfect physical and behavioral mimicry
- Digestion period reduced (6-12 hours)
- Partial memory absorption from prey
- Can acquire and utilize B-rank skills
- Fine control over transformation aspects
- Taste aversion replaced with pleasure (consumption feels rewarding)
- Can selectively consume parts for specific abilities
- Developed hunting instincts for optimal prey

**Master (Level 10): Ultimate Predator**
- Can consume almost any organic entity regardless of size
- 20+ skills can be retained simultaneously
- Perfect mimicry including memories and minor abilities
- Rapid digestion (1-3 hours)
- Permanent skill acquisition possible for compatible abilities
- Can acquire and utilize A-rank skills
- Potential to consume S-rank skills from appropriate targets
- Complete control over transformation process
- Deep hunger for powerful abilities becomes defining trait
- Capacity to create unique hybrid skills from multiple sources

### 3.2 Advancement Requirements

To progress the Predator skill, users must:

1. Consume a minimum number of unique creatures for each level
2. Successfully integrate progressively higher-ranked skills
3. Master controlling previously acquired abilities
4. Overcome the psychological barriers of consumption
5. Evolve their magicule structure to accommodate greater power

## 4.0 Skill Acquisition & Management

### 4.1 Skill Analysis

When a target is consumed, the Predator skill automatically analyzes the entity's abilities:

- **Compatibility Check**: Determines if skills can be integrated
- **Rank Assessment**: Evaluates the power level of available skills
- **Integration Difficulty**: Calculates time and energy required
- **Potential Modifications**: Identifies necessary adaptations for user's body

For users with the Great Sage ability, this analysis is dramatically enhanced, providing detailed breakdowns of skill components and optimization opportunities.

### 4.2 Skill Integration

Successfully analyzed skills undergo integration:

- **Temporary Integration**: Initial acquisition provides time-limited access
- **Skill Practice**: Regular use strengthens the connection
- **Permanent Bonding**: Fully mastered skills become permanent with sufficient use
- **Skill Mutation**: Occasionally skills adapt to user's nature, creating unique variants

### 4.3 Skill Management

With limited capacity, users must manage their acquired abilities:

- **Skill Prioritization**: Choosing which abilities to maintain
- **Skill Combinations**: Creating synergies between complementary abilities
- **Skill Replacement**: Deciding which abilities to discard when reaching capacity
- **Consumption Cycles**: Regularly consuming similar entities to reinforce valuable skills

### 4.4 Skill Capacity Formula

```
Base Capacity = 1 + (Predator Level × 2)
Bonus Capacity = INT modifier + WIS modifier
Total Capacity = Base Capacity + Bonus Capacity
```

Higher intelligence and wisdom allow more efficient skill organization and storage.

## 5.0 Form Mimicry

For slimes, doppelgangers, and other beings with malleable physiology, Predator enables physical transformation to match consumed entities.

### 5.1 Transformation Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Complete Consumption] --> B[Full Digestion]
    B --> C[Form Analysis]
    C --> D[Physical Restructuring]
    D --> E[Species Trait Acquisition]
    E --> F[Behavioral Imitation]
```

**Physical Restructuring:**
- Body mass redistributes to match target's dimensions
- Surface texture, coloration, and features form
- Internal organs may be simulated if necessary
- Transformation speed increases with skill level

**Species Trait Acquisition:**
- Basic biological functions (breathing, circulation) are mimicked
- Natural abilities (night vision, enhanced smell) are replicated
- Innate resistances (poison immunity, fire resistance) are gained
- Physical strength and weaknesses are approximated

**Behavioral Imitation:**
- Voice patterns matched through vocal cord restructuring
- Movement patterns and mannerisms replicated
- At higher levels, instinctual behaviors are adopted
- Advanced mimicry includes emotional responses and reactions

### 5.2 Mimicry Limitations

Despite its power, Form Mimicry has significant constraints:

- **Magical Signature**: Cannot replicate unique magical auras
- **Soul Essence**: Cannot duplicate soul-based abilities
- **Divine Traits**: Cannot copy divinely granted features
- **Size Constraints**: Transformation limited by user's mass (can increase by 50% or decrease by 75%)
- **Aura Detection**: High-level magic users can sense the disguise
- **Energy Consumption**: Maintaining complex forms drains resources
- **Identity Retention**: Extended mimicry risks psychological blending

## 6.0 Limitations & Balance

### 6.1 Physiological Constraints

**Consumption Hazards:**
- Poisonous entities may cause illness unless neutralized
- Cursed beings may transfer their afflictions
- Divine entities might trigger violent rejection reactions
- Incompatible magicule structures can cause internal damage
- Excessive consumption without digestion causes bloating and vulnerability

**Evolution Requirements:**
- Physical adaptations needed for consuming larger prey
- Specialized digestive abilities for different entity types
- Enhanced magicule processing capacity for powerful skills
- Incremental changes to accommodate new ability types

### 6.2 Psychological Impact

**Mental Corruption:**
- Progressive appetite development toward more powerful beings
- Risk of personality bleed from consumed entities
- Predatory instincts becoming dominant over time
- Gradual detachment from human morality and connections
- Identity confusion after extensive mimicry
- Potential development of consumption-based euphoria

**Countermeasures:**
- Regular meditation to reinforce core identity
- Selective consumption of compatible entities
- Periods of abstention to clear foreign influences
- Strong emotional anchors to human connections
- Great Sage ability can help manage mental contamination

### 6.3 Social Consequences

**Hunter Becomes Hunted:**
- Radiant Covenant classifies users as dangerous heretics
- Templars and Inquisitors actively hunt known Predator wielders
- Mage guilds seek to study or contain users
- Monster hunters receive bounties for confirmed kills
- Certain demonic entities view users as rivals or threats

**Ethical Implications:**
- Consuming sentient beings raises profound moral questions
- Users often face internal conflict about their nature
- History of previous Predator wielders often marked by tragedy
- Potential path to either transcendence or monstrosity

## 7.0 Memory Thread Integration

Predator creates unique memory threads that track consumption history and acquired abilities.

## 1.0 Overview

In Vantiel, survival is more than just staying alive—it's about managing resources, adapting to the environment, and building a sustainable lifestyle. This system governs the basic necessities of daily life, from food and water to shelter and rest, as well as the management of personal belongings and property.

Every meal eaten, night of rest taken, and item carried tells a story about your character's priorities, resources, and adaptability. The changing seasons, regional climates, and local economies all influence how you approach survival, creating a dynamic and immersive living experience that grounds your adventure in a believable world.

## 2. Carrying Capacity

### 2.1 Weight Limits

The fundamental restrictions on what characters can physically carry:

#### Base Carrying Capacity
- **Standard Formula**: Strength score × 15 = maximum carrying weight in pounds
- **Unencumbered Limit**: Strength score × 5 = weight carried without penalty
- **Heavy Load**: Weight between unencumbered limit and maximum capacity
- **Overloaded**: Temporarily exceeding maximum capacity (with penalties)
- **Absolute Maximum**: Strength score × 30 = maximum that can be lifted briefly

#### Strength Scaling
| Strength | Unencumbered | Heavy Load | Maximum Capacity | Absolute Maximum |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------------|------------------|
| 8 | 40 lbs | 120 lbs | 120 lbs | 240 lbs |
| 10 | 50 lbs | 150 lbs | 150 lbs | 300 lbs |
| 12 | 60 lbs | 180 lbs | 180 lbs | 360 lbs |
| 14 | 70 lbs | 210 lbs | 210 lbs | 420 lbs |
| 16 | 80 lbs | 240 lbs | 240 lbs | 480 lbs |
| 18 | 90 lbs | 270 lbs | 270 lbs | 540 lbs |
| 20 | 100 lbs | 300 lbs | 300 lbs | 600 lbs |

#### Size Modifiers
- **Tiny**: Half carrying capacity
- **Small**: 3/4 carrying capacity
- **Medium**: Standard carrying capacity
- **Large**: Double carrying capacity
- **Huge**: Quadruple carrying capacity

#### Special Modifiers
- **Racial Traits**: Some races have natural carrying capacity bonuses
- **Class Abilities**: Certain classes gain enhanced carrying capacity
- **Magical Effects**: Spells and items that increase strength or carrying capacity
- **Encumbrance Reduction**: Skills or abilities that reduce effective weight
- **Burden Distribution**: Techniques for optimizing how weight is carried

### 2.2 Encumbrance Effects

The consequences of carrying heavy loads:

#### Movement Penalties
- **Unencumbered**: No movement penalty
- **Lightly Encumbered**: -5 feet to movement speed
- **Heavily Encumbered**: -10 feet to movement speed, disadvantage on physical checks
- **Overloaded**: Speed reduced to 5 feet, disadvantage on all physical actions
- **Immobilized**: Cannot move when exceeding absolute maximum

#### Combat Penalties
- **Initiative Penalty**: -1 per encumbrance level
- **Attack Penalty**: -1 per encumbrance level
- **Dodge Difficulty**: Increased difficulty to avoid attacks
- **Spell Failure**: Chance of spell failure when heavily encumbered
- **Fatigue Accumulation**: Faster stamina drain when encumbered

#### Skill Penalties
- **Acrobatics/Athletics**: Disadvantage when encumbered
- **Stealth**: Penalty based on encumbrance level
- **Swimming**: Increased difficulty and risk of sinking
- **Climbing**: Reduced climbing speed and increased difficulty
- **Endurance**: Reduced duration for physically demanding activities

#### Long-Term Effects
- **Fatigue**: Extended travel while encumbered causes exhaustion
- **Injury Risk**: Higher chance of strain or injury when encumbered
- **Recovery Time**: Longer rest required after exertion while encumbered
- **Terrain Difficulty**: Encumbrance magnifies penalties from difficult terrain
- **Weather Vulnerability**: Encumbered characters more affected by extreme weather

### 2.3 Capacity Optimization

Methods for maximizing effective carrying capacity:

#### Strength Enhancement
- **Training**: Character development to increase base Strength
- **Magical Enhancement**: Spells and items that boost Strength
- **Potions**: Temporary Strength increases
- **Specialized Equipment**: Items designed to distribute weight effectively
- **Burden-Sharing Techniques**: Methods to optimize how weight is carried

#### Capacity-Enhancing Items
- **Bags of Holding**: Magical containers with expanded internal space
- **Efficient Packs**: Well-designed backpacks that distribute weight
- **Strength-Enhancing Gear**: Belts, gauntlets, and other items that boost carrying capacity
- **Lightweight Materials**: Special materials that weigh less than standard
- **Collapsible Equipment**: Items that can be compressed when not in use

#### Companion Assistance
- **Pack Animals**: Horses, mules, and other beasts of burden
- **Hired Porters**: NPCs who carry equipment for a fee
- **Magical Servants**: Conjured entities that can bear loads
- **Mechanical Carriers**: Carts, wagons, and other vehicles
- **Companion Load-Sharing**: Distribution of weight among party members

## 3. Item Properties

The standard weight categories for items in Vantiel:

#### Weight Categories
- **Negligible**: Less than 0.1 lbs (coins, gems, small herbs)
- **Light**: 0.1-1 lbs (daggers, scrolls, potions)
- **Medium**: 1-5 lbs (swords, books, tools)
- **Heavy**: 5-15 lbs (armor pieces, large weapons)
- **Very Heavy**: 15+ lbs (full plate armor, large equipment)

#### Common Item Weights
| Item Type | Typical Weight | Examples |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Light Weapons | 1-2 lbs | Dagger (1 lb), Short Sword (2 lbs) |
| Medium Weapons | 3-5 lbs | Longsword (3 lbs), Battleaxe (4 lbs) |
| Heavy Weapons | 6-10 lbs | Greatsword (6 lbs), Warhammer (8 lbs) |
| Light Armor | 10-15 lbs | Leather Armor (10 lbs), Chain Shirt (15 lbs) |
| Medium Armor | 20-30 lbs | Scale Mail (25 lbs), Breastplate (20 lbs) |
| Heavy Armor | 40-65 lbs | Chain Mail (40 lbs), Plate Armor (65 lbs) |
| Shields | 3-15 lbs | Buckler (3 lbs), Tower Shield (15 lbs) |
| Basic Supplies | 1-2 lbs | Rations (1 lb/day), Waterskin (2 lbs when full) |
| Tools | 2-5 lbs | Thieves' Tools (2 lbs), Smith's Tools (5 lbs) |
| Magical Items | Varies | Potion (0.5 lbs), Spellbook (3 lbs) |

#### Weight Reduction Factors
- **Masterwork Crafting**: 10-20% weight reduction
- **Special Materials**: Up to 50% weight reduction for rare materials
- **Magical Enhancement**: Enchantments that reduce effective weight
- **Size Adaptation**: Items sized for smaller creatures weigh less
- **Collapsible Design**: Items that can be folded or compressed

### 3.2 Size Categories

From the weight of a warrior's armor to the careful organization of a mage's components, from the durability of weapons to the capacity of magical storage, inventory management touches every aspect of character development and adventure.

Through carrying capacity limitations, characters must make strategic decisions about their equipment loadout, prioritizing items that best serve their immediate needs while finding creative solutions for transporting or storing less urgent possessions. The durability system ensures that equipment maintenance becomes an important consideration, creating both narrative opportunities and economic decisions about when to repair, replace, or upgrade.

The integration with other systems—combat, crafting, economy, and magic—ensures that inventory management is not an isolated mechanic but a cohesive part of the overall gameplay experience. Whether managing a merchant caravan's cargo, optimizing a dungeon delver's backpack, or organizing a wizard's laboratory, the inventory system provides the framework for realistic and engaging item management in the world of Vantiel.
