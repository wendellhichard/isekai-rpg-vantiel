# Advanced Classes of Vantiel


## 1. Overview

Advanced Classes represent rare, powerful specializations that go beyond the capabilities of standard classes. These classes typically cannot be chosen at character creation and must be unlocked through specific achievements, quests, or circumstances within the game world.  Monarch classes are unique in that only one living person may have the class at any time in the world of Vantiel, there may never be two shadow monarchs, or two beast monarchs.   There can be one of each.    Do not introduce any monarchs until the player has become one themselves.  (To allow for player agency of which class they take)

Each Advanced Class represents a significant power enhancement and unique playstyle that transforms the character's capabilities and role in the world. These classes often carry narrative weight, with NPCs reacting to these rare and often feared abilities.

## 2. The Shadow Monarch

*"Arise."*

A single word spoken in the darkness, and the fallen rise again - not as the undead, but as shadows bound to the will of their new master. The Shadow Monarch commands an ever-growing army of shadow soldiers extracted from defeated enemies, wielding the power of death itself as both weapon and armor.

### 2.1 Class Identity

The Shadow Monarch transcends traditional necromancy, creating not mindless undead but loyal shadow servants that retain their skills and intelligence from life. As the monarch's power grows, so too does their shadow army, eventually becoming a force that can challenge entire kingdoms.

**Core Fantasy**: Command an army of shadows that grows with each powerful enemy defeated

**Narrative Role**: A figure inspiring both awe and terror, walking the line between hero and conqueror

**Playstyle**: Strategic commander who grows stronger with each victory, turning enemies into assets

**Primary Attributes**: Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma

### 2.2 Acquisition Requirements

The Shadow Monarch class cannot be chosen at character creation. Instead, it must be unlocked through specific circumstances:

- **The Monarch's Trial**: Completion of a special high-difficulty dungeon where the character faces overwhelming odds alone
- **Near-Death Experience**: Surviving a situation where death seemed certain
- **Affinity for Darkness**: Having used shadow or death magic extensively
- **The Black Heart**: A rare magical artifact that resonates with those destined to command shadows

The specific requirements can vary based on the campaign, but should always represent a significant challenge and narrative milestone.

### 2.3 Core Abilities

#### Shadow Extraction

The defining ability of the Shadow Monarch is the power to extract and bind the shadows of defeated enemies:

**Command Word**: The Shadow Monarch must designate a personal command word (canonically "Arise") that activates the extraction

**Extraction Process**:
- When an enemy is defeated, a shadowy haze may appear over their corpse
- The Shadow Monarch speaks their command word while focusing on the fallen enemy
- The shadow rises from the corpse, taking a form similar to its living appearance but composed of dark energy
- The shadow pledges eternal loyalty to the monarch
- The extraction consumes MP based on the power of the creature being extracted

**Extraction Chance**:
- Base success rate depends on the ratio between the monarch's level and the enemy's level
- Equal level: 65% success chance
- Each level above the enemy: +5% success chance
- Each level below the enemy: -10% success chance
- Critical success (natural 20 on extraction roll): Shadow retains a unique ability from life
- Critical failure (natural 1): Cannot attempt to extract this particular shadow again

**Shadow Properties**:
- Shadows maintain the skills and combat abilities they had in life
- Intelligence remains intact, including memories and personality
- Complete loyalty to the Shadow Monarch overrides all previous allegiances
- Shadows understand complex commands and can operate independently
- Shadows cannot be turned or controlled by other necromancers

#### Shadow Storage

The extracted shadows reside within the Shadow Monarch's own shadow when not active:

**Storage Capacity**:
- Initial capacity: 10 shadows
- Additional capacity gained per level: +2 shadows
- No MP cost for storing shadows - they remain dormant indefinitely
- Stored shadows are undetectable except by the most powerful magical sensing

**Summoning Process**:
- Mental command to call forth specific shadows
- MP cost per summon: 5 MP Ã— Shadow Rank Modifier
  - Shadow Soldiers (Rank 1): 5 MP
  - Shadow Knights (Rank 2): 10 MP
  - Shadow Generals (Rank 3): 15 MP
- No time limit on how long summoned shadows can remain active
- Maximum number of simultaneously active shadows limited by level
  - Base value: 3 shadows
  - Additional active shadows per 3 levels: +1

**Shadow Resilience**:
- When defeated in combat, shadows return to the monarch's shadow
- Can be resummoned with the same MP cost as initial summoning
- No cooldown required for resummoning
- Shadows retain all experience and abilities when resummoned

#### Shadow Exchange

The ability to instantly swap positions with any active shadow:

**Activation**:
- Mental command targeting a specific active shadow
- MP Cost: 10 MP
- Casting Time: Instant (can be used as a reaction)

**Tactical Applications**:
- Escape dangerous situations
- Reposition for surprise attacks
- Reach otherwise inaccessible locations
- Protect vulnerable allies by swapping them with shadows
- Create confusion on the battlefield

**Limitations**:
- Cooldown: 1 round per 5 levels (minimum 1 round)
- Range: Limited by line of sight or magical connection
- Cannot exchange with shadows in separate dimensional spaces
- Target shadow must have sufficient space for the exchange

### 2.4 Shadow Army Hierarchy

The shadows under a Shadow Monarch's command fall into a natural hierarchy based on their power in life:

#### Shadow Soldiers

The foundation of the shadow army, extracted from common enemies:

**Source**: Standard enemies, weaker foes, common monsters
**Role**: Frontline troops, scouts, grunt work
**Abilities**: Basic combat skills, simple tool use
**Intelligence**: Follows direct orders, limited tactical thinking
**Strength Equivalent**: 70-90% of original creature's power
**Appearance**: Resembles their original form but stronger, covered in black armor that looks like liquid darkness, there is a fluidity to it. Blue flames emanate from joint spaces and openings, creating an otherworldly aura around the shadow.
**MP Cost**: 5 MP to summon

#### Shadow Knights

Mid-tier shadows that serve as the backbone of the monarch's elite forces:

**Source**: Elite enemies, mini-bosses, powerful humanoids
**Role**: Specialized combat roles, unit leaders, skilled tasks
**Abilities**: Advanced combat techniques, specialized skills
**Intelligence**: Capable of complex tactics, can lead soldier units
**Strength Equivalent**: 80-100% of original creature's power
**Appearance**: Enhanced version of their original form, encased in elaborate black armor that ripples like liquid darkness. Brighter blue flames emerge from joints and helmet visors, with occasional flickers of energy visible beneath the armor's surface.
**MP Cost**: 10 MP to summon

#### Shadow Generals

The most powerful shadows, commanding significant portions of the shadow army:

**Source**: Major bosses, legendary creatures, unique enemies
**Role**: Army commanders, personal guards, specialized operations
**Abilities**: Exceptional combat prowess, unique powers, leadership
**Intelligence**: Fully independent thinking, complex strategy, personal initiative
**Strength Equivalent**: 90-110% of original creature's power
**Appearance**: Majestic, imposing versions of their original forms, wrapped in intricate shadow armor with regal elements unique to each general. Intense blue flames burn constantly from joints, eyes, and weapon edges, sometimes forming patterns or symbols in the air around them.
**MP Cost**: 15 MP to summon

### 2.5 Shadow Growth System

Both individual shadows and the shadow army as a whole grow stronger over time:

#### Individual Shadow Progression

Shadows can increase in power through various means:

**Battle Experience**:
- Shadows gain XP from combat participation
- XP required for shadow levels scales with shadow rank
- Each level increases shadow's stats by a small percentage
- Milestone levels (5, 10, 15, etc.) may unlock new abilities

**Skill Development**:
- Shadows can learn new skills through repeated use
- Skills related to their original abilities develop faster
- Can potentially learn skills from other shadows through training
- Maximum skill level limited by shadow's rank and intelligence

**Evolution**:
- At certain milestones, shadows may evolve to a higher rank
- Shadow Soldiers â†’ Shadow Knights â†’ Shadow Generals
- Evolution requires specific conditions:
  - Achieving a certain level
  - Completing special challenges
  - Absorbing the essence of similar shadows

#### Army Synergy

The shadow army becomes greater than the sum of its parts:

**Formation Bonuses**:
- Specific shadow combinations provide tactical advantages
- Similar shadow types gain efficiency when working together
- Complementary abilities between shadows unlock synergy attacks
- Leadership hierarchy improves overall army effectiveness

**Command Efficiency**:
- Higher Shadow Monarch level improves multi-shadow coordination
- Special abilities allow commanding multiple shadow groups
- Advanced tactics become available as the army grows
- Shadow generals can command lower-rank shadows independently

### 2.6 Progression Path

The Shadow Monarch grows in power along a distinct path:

#### Monarch's Awakening (Levels 1-5)

The initial manifestation of shadow powers:

- **Shadow Extraction (Basic)**: Can extract shadows from creatures of equal or lower level
- **Shadow Storage**: Can store up to 10 shadows
- **Active Shadow Limit**: 3 shadows at once

- **Active Shadow Limit**: 10 shadows at once
- **Shadow Exchange (Mastered)**: Unlimited range exchanges with no cooldown
- **Shadow Realm**: Create a temporary domain of shadow where the monarch's powers are enhanced

### 2.7 Balancing Considerations

While extremely powerful, the Shadow Monarch has significant limitations:

#### Resource Management

- MP-intensive summoning requires careful resource management
- Active shadow limit prevents overwhelming force in every encounter
- Higher-rank shadows require significant investment to summon

#### Situational Effectiveness

- Less effective in areas of pure light or holy ground
- Certain enemies may be resistant to shadow abilities
- Anti-necromantic abilities can temporarily disable shadows

#### Narrative Consequences

- Many societies view shadow manipulation as forbidden magic
- Religious organizations may consider the Shadow Monarch heretical
- Acquiring too much power too quickly may attract powerful enemies

#### Skill Development

- Requires time to build an effective shadow army
- Most powerful abilities only available at higher levels
- Learning to command multiple shadows effectively takes practice

### 2.8 Roleplay Considerations

The Shadow Monarch class brings unique roleplay opportunities:

#### The Burden of Command

- Growing responsibility with each shadow under command
- Ethical questions about the nature of extracted shadows
- Balance between using power and becoming corrupted by it

#### Shadow Personalities

- Extracted shadows retain personalities and memories
- Potential for interesting interactions between monarch and shadows
- Shadows may have conflicting loyalties from their previous life, though ultimate loyalty is to the monarch

#### Narrative Impact

- NPCs react with fear, awe, or hostility to shadow abilities
- Legends and prophecies may speak of the rise of a Shadow Monarch
- Political powers may seek to control or destroy such a powerful force

#### The Path to Power

- Temptation to seek out powerful enemies specifically for extraction
- Growing disconnection from normal society as power increases
- Potential transformation from hero to feared conqueror

## 3. Integration with Other Systems

### 3.1 Advanced Combat Integration

The Shadow Monarch's abilities integrate with the combat system in sophisticated ways that transform battlefield dynamics:

#### Combat Formations

Shadows can be arranged in specific formations for tactical advantages:

- **Phalanx Formation**: Shadow soldiers form a defensive wall, granting +2 AC to all participants
- **Pincer Formation**: Shadows position for flanking, gaining +25% damage against surrounded targets
- **Vanguard Formation**: General-rank shadow leads from front, granting +1 to all attack rolls for shadows behind them
- **Ambush Formation**: Shadows blend with environmental shadows for surprise attacks with +3 initiative
- **Defensive Circle**: Outward-facing ring provides +3 AC against ranged attacks when protecting allies

#### Synchronized Combat

The Shadow Monarch can execute coordinated attacks with their shadows:

- **Shadow Strike**: Monarch and shadows attack same target simultaneously for bonus damage
- **Chain Assault**: Sequential attacks that build cumulative damage bonuses
- **Distraction Tactics**: Shadows create openings, granting advantage on monarch's attacks
- **Sacrificial Defender**: Shadow intercepts attack meant for monarch or ally (shadow is dismissed)
- **Shadow Echo**: Shadows mimic the monarch's combat techniques with scaled effectiveness

#### Battlefield Control

Strategic deployment of shadows transforms area control:

- **Zone Denial**: Shadows control territory, applying movement penalties to enemies
- **Shadow Wall**: Line of shadows creates partial cover or blocks enemy advancement
- **Sensory Manipulation**: Shadows absorb light, creating areas of darkness that benefit the monarch
- **Terrain Exploitation**: Shadows take advantage of elevation, cover, and environmental features
- **Target Isolation**: Shadows separate priority enemies from their allies for focused elimination

#### Shadow Combat Roles

Shadows can be assigned specialized battlefield roles:

- **Vanguard**: Front-line shadows that engage primary threats
- **Sentinel**: Defensive shadows that protect the monarch and allies
- **Assassin**: Precision shadows that target vulnerable enemies
- **Controller**: Shadows that disrupt enemy formations and spellcasters
- **Support**: Shadows that enhance the capabilities of other shadows or allies

### 3.2 Magic System Integration

Shadow abilities interact with traditional magic in unique ways:

- **Magic Detection**: Shadow magic registers differently from traditional arcane or divine magic
- **Spell Interactions**: Specific spells may enhance or hinder shadow abilities
- **Elemental Relationship**: Strong affinity with darkness, weakness to pure light
- **Magical Research**: Shadow abilities can be studied and potentially enhanced through magical theory

### 3.3 Memory Thread Integration

The Shadow Monarch creates unique memory threads:

```json
{
  "shadow_monarch_memory": {
    "class_awakening": {
      "date": "Winter, Year 3",
      "location": "Ancient Crypt of Maladir",

        "Offered alliance by Twilight Covenant",
        "Sought as research subject by Arcane Academy"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.4 Shadow Independent Operations

One of the Shadow Monarch's most versatile advantages is the ability to send shadows to perform tasks independently:

#### Mission Types

Shadows can be assigned various missions away from the monarch:

- **Reconnaissance**: Scouting areas ahead of the party, reporting back with detailed information
- **Resource Gathering**: Collecting materials, herbs, or other items from known locations
- **Guard Duty**: Protecting specific locations, objects, or persons in the monarch's absence
- **Message Delivery**: Carrying communications to distant allies without risk of interception
- **Tracking**: Following specific targets without detection, reporting movement patterns
- **Ambush Preparation**: Setting up tactical positions ahead of the monarch's arrival
- **Covert Operations**: Sending your shadows to hide within the shadows of other people, for spying or other reasons.

#### Mission Parameters

Independent operations follow structured rules:

- **Range Limitation**: Maximum distance based on monarch's level and shadow's rank
  - Basic: 1 mile per monarch level
  - Extended: 3 miles per level for knight-rank and above
  - Remote: 10 miles per level for general-rank

- **Duration**: How long shadows can operate independently
  - Basic: 1 hour per monarch level
  - Extended: 6 hours per level for knight-rank and above
  - Prolonged: 24 hours per level for general-rank

- **Communication**: Methods for shadows to report findings
  - Basic: Shadow must return to report
  - Advanced: Mental link allows limited status updates (level 10+)
  - Complete: Full sensory sharing with general-rank shadows (level 15+)

- **Complexity**: Types of instructions shadows can follow
  - Basic: Simple, specific instructions with little adaptation
  - Advanced: Multi-stage tasks with decision trees
  - Complex: Open-ended missions requiring significant judgment

#### Mission Resolution

How shadow missions conclude:

- **Success/Failure Determination**: Based on shadow rank, difficulty, and dice rolls
- **Shadow Return**: Automatic recall to monarch upon completion or failure
- **Experience Gains**: Shadows gain additional XP from independent missions
- **Report Integration**: Information gathered is added to monarch's memory threads
- **Resource Recovery**: Items gathered are delivered directly to monarch

### 3.5 Vast Coordination System

As the Shadow Monarch grows in power, their ability to coordinate multiple shadows simultaneously becomes increasingly sophisticated:

#### Mental Command Network

The Shadow Monarch develops a complex mental link with their shadows:

- **Hive Mind Connection**: Share information instantly across all active shadows
- **Layered Commands**: Issue primary and contingency orders simultaneously
- **Priority System**: Establish command hierarchies for different situations
- **Tactical Override**: Instantly adjust all shadow actions when conditions change
- **Battlefield Awareness**: Maintain complete tactical picture through shadow perspectives

#### Command Efficiency

Methods for controlling multiple shadows efficiently:

- **Group Commands**: Issue single orders that apply to multiple shadows
- **Command Templates**: Pre-planned tactical packages that can be activated instantly
- **Delegation Chain**: General-rank shadows relay commands to lower ranks
- **Autonomous Protocols**: Standing orders that shadows follow without direct input
- **Focus Shifting**: Rapidly transition attention between different shadow groups

#### Sensory Integration

The monarch can access and process information from their shadows:

- **Vision Sharing**: See through any shadow's eyes as an action
- **Multi-Sensory Awareness**: Experience what shadows feel, hear, and sense
- **Danger Recognition**: Automatic alerts when shadows encounter threats
- **Mapping Integration**: Build mental maps from shadow explorations
- **Target Tracking**: Maintain awareness of enemy positions through shadow observation

#### Range and Limitations
Shadows are able to act independently of the monarchs control, once given orders.  Communication may be an issue for the monarch in the early levels.

Factors affecting the coordination system:

- **Connection Range**: Base range of 100 feet per monarch level for direct control
- **Signal Degradation**: Reduced control precision at extreme distances
- **Focus Requirements**: Maintaining control of many shadows requires concentration
- **Interference Factors**: Magical barriers or certain environments may disrupt connection
- **Control Recovery**: Methods to re-establish control if connection is broken

## 4. Sample Shadow Abilities

Below are example abilities that shadows might possess based on their original form:

### Humanoid Shadows

- **Weapon Mastery**: Retains combat skills from life
- **Tactical Awareness**: Understands and executes complex battle plans
- **Tool Proficiency**: Can use equipment and tools effectively
- **Stealth Operations**: Can perform infiltration and reconnaissance

### Monster Shadows

- **Natural Weapons**: Claws, fangs, and other biological weapons
- **Monstrous Strength**: Enhanced physical capabilities
- **Terrifying Presence**: Can frighten enemies
- **Special Attacks**: Unique abilities from their monstrous nature

### Magical Shadows

- **Spell Retention**: Can cast spells known in life (MP cost paid by shadow)
- **Elemental Affinity**: Control over specific elemental forces
- **Magic Resistance**: Enhanced protection against spells
- **Enchanted Attacks**: Weapons infused with magical energy

## Conclusion

The Shadow Monarch represents one of Vantiel's most unique and powerful advanced classes. Through the ability to extract, command, and grow an army of shadows, the monarch creates a force that becomes increasingly formidable with each victory.

While this path offers tremendous power, it also brings significant narrative consequences and careful balance considerations. The Shadow Monarch walks a line between savior and conqueror, between master of death and its servant.

For those rare individuals who unlock this path, the question becomes not whether they can amass power, but what they will do with it once they command an army that grows with each fallen foe.

## 2. Class Identity

The Beast Monarch transcends traditional Beast Taming magic, forging connections with the natural world that go beyond simple contracts or control. They are recognized by nature itself as its rightful ruler, a living conduit between the civilized world and the primal forces of life.

**Core Fantasy**: Becoming one with nature, commanding the loyalty of beasts while embodying their most powerful aspects

**Narrative Role**: Nature's voice, mediator between civilization and wilderness, protector of the natural balance

**Playstyle**: Versatile shapeshifter and commander who can adapt to any environment by drawing on the strengths of countless creatures

**Primary Attributes**: Wisdom, Charisma, and Constitution

## 3. Acquisition Requirements

The Beast Monarch class cannot be chosen at character creation. It represents a unique mantle of power that can only be claimed through an extraordinary journey of communion with nature. Only one Beast Monarch can exist in the world at any time.

### 3.1 Prerequisites

To be considered as a potential Beast Monarch, a character must:

- **Master Beast Tamer**: Reach the highest level (10) in the Beast Taming skill
- **The Perfect Bond**: Form at least one permanent contract with a creature that evolves to its ultimate form through your bond
- **The Wilderness Trial**: Survive alone in the wild for one lunar cycle, forming temporary contracts with at least 20 different species
- **The Ancient Communion**: Locate and commune with one of Vantiel's Ancient Beast Spirits at a sacred site
- **The Monarch's Challenge**: If another Beast Monarch exists, you must either:
   - Receive their willing blessing as their successor
   - Defeat them in a ritual challenge that tests not combat prowess but worthiness to lead nature
- **The Sacrifice**: Willingly sever your strongest bond, releasing your most powerful companion back to the wild (showing you respect nature's freedom)

### 3.2 The Transformation Ritual

Once these requirements are met, the candidate experiences "The Calling" - dreams filled with the voices of beasts summoning them to the Heart of the Wild (a legendary location that appears differently to each Beast Monarch candidate). There, they undergo a transformation ritual:

- The candidate is surrounded by spectral forms of every creature they've ever bonded with
- Their body is unmade and reformed by primal magic
- The essence of the Ancient Beast Spirits flows into them
- They experience the lives of countless creatures simultaneously
- If a previous Beast Monarch exists and has given their blessing, their power transfers directly
- The world itself acknowledges the rise of a new Beast Monarch through natural phenomenaâ€”storms, animal migrations, or blooming vegetation out of season

This ritual permanently transforms the character into the Beast Monarch, granting them powers beyond those of any normal beast tamer or druid.

The Beast Monarch represents one of Vantiel's most unique and powerful advanced classes. Through the singular mantle of nature's sovereign, the character transcends the normal boundaries between humanoid and beast, becoming a true force of natural balance in the world.

This path offers tremendous power but also weighty responsibility, as the Beast Monarch becomes not just a powerful individual but nature's voice and protector. The ability to transform into countless creatures, command beasts across vast distances, and influence the very patterns of the natural world comes with the burden of maintaining the delicate balance of all life.

For the one individual who attains this mantle in each age, the question becomes not just how to use these powers, but how to bear the responsibility of being the living bridge between civilization and wilderness, between the mortal world and the timeless cycles of nature itself.
