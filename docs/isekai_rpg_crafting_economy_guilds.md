## 1.0 Overview

The art of creation lies at the heart of civilization. Every tool shaped, every garment sewn, every structure raised tells a story of human ingenuity and skill. This system governs how raw materials become the foundations of survival and progress, from mundane crafting to magical creation.

Crafting in Vantiel transcends mere mechanics—it's a narrative journey that reflects your character's values, background, and growth. Your physical condition affects your crafting ability, relationships enable learning and collaboration, and Thread-Sight allows perception of material essence. Python-driven mechanics handle crafting calculations, quality checks, and difficulty adjustments.

Every item crafted carries your maker's mark—both literally and figuratively—becoming part of your legacy in the world. The choices you make in crafting—from material selection to who benefits from your creations—shape your reputation, relationships, and the stories told about you long after you've moved on.

#### 8.5.1 Failure Types

Crafting failures come in many forms, each with unique consequences and recovery paths:

**Material Failures**
- **Impurity Issues**: Unexpected flaws in materials compromise integrity
- **Compatibility Problems**: Materials react poorly when combined
- **Structural Weakness**: Material breaks or warps during processing
- **Quality Variance**: Materials don't perform as expected due to quality inconsistencies
- **Decay or Degradation**: Materials deteriorate during the crafting process

**Process Failures**
- **Technique Error**: Improper application of crafting methods
- **Sequence Mistake**: Steps performed in wrong order
- **Timing Issues**: Incorrect duration for crucial steps
- **Temperature Problems**: Too hot or cold during critical phases
- **Pressure Mistakes**: Too much or little force applied

**Tool Failures**
- **Breakage**: Tools break during use
- **Wear and Tear**: Tools perform poorly due to condition
- **Inappropriate Tools**: Wrong tool used for the job
- **Calibration Issues**: Tools misaligned or improperly set
- **Quality Mismatch**: Tool quality insufficient for material or technique

**Environmental Failures**
- **Weather Effects**: Humidity, temperature, or wind interferes
- **Workspace Issues**: Inadequate space or poor setup
- **Contamination**: Dust, dirt, or other contaminants affect process
- **Interruptions**: External disturbances break concentration
- **Resource Limitations**: Insufficient light, water, heat, etc.

**Physical Limitations**
- **Fatigue**: Declining performance due to exhaustion
- **Injury Complications**: Physical limitations from injuries
- **Skill Mismatch**: Attempting techniques beyond current skill
- **Concentration Lapse**: Mental focus breaks at critical moment
- **Physical Tremors**: Hand unsteadiness affects precision

#### 8.5.2 Failure Spectrum

Failures range in severity and provide different narrative and gameplay opportunities:

**Minor Setback (Miss DC by 1-3)**
- Small imperfections that don't affect function
- Extra time required to correct minor issues
- Slight increase in material consumption
- Reduced aesthetic quality but functional item
- Learning opportunity with minimal consequences

**Partial Failure (Miss DC by 4-7)**
- Functional issues that limit item effectiveness
- Significant additional time required to salvage
- Notable material waste requiring replacements
- Reduced durability or reliability
- Item usable but clearly flawed

**Complete Failure (Miss DC by 8-10)**
- Item non-functional or unsafe to use
- Time investment entirely wasted
- Significant material loss (50-75%)
- Requires starting over from scratch
- Potential tool damage

**Catastrophic Failure (Miss DC by 11+ or Critical Failure)**
- Dangerous failure with potential injury
- All materials ruined beyond salvage
- Possible tool destruction
- Workspace damage requiring cleanup/repair
- Risk of reputation damage if public

**Unexpected Outcome (Special Failure Type)**
- Creation works but with completely unintended properties
- Accidentally discovering new techniques or recipes
- Creating unique items with unexpected benefits or drawbacks
- Serendipitous discoveries through failure
- Potential for innovation through careful analysis

#### 8.5.3 Context-Based Failure Assessment

When determining crafting failures, multiple factors are considered:

**Assessment Factors**
- **Crafter's Experience**: Previous work with similar items
- **Material Familiarity**: Knowledge of material properties
- **Tool Proficiency**: Comfort and skill with required tools
- **Recipe Complexity**: Intricacy and difficulty of design
- **Workspace Conditions**: Quality and suitability of environment
- **Physical State**: Health, rest, and condition of crafter
- **Previous Attempts**: History of success or failure with item
- **Hard Mode Status**: Whether strict rules are being applied

**Example Assessment:**
```
[Sword Crafting Assessment - Hidden]
• Crafter Skill: Journeyman Blacksmith (+)
• Material Quality: High-grade steel (+)
• Tool Condition: Well-maintained but standard (neutral)
• Workspace: Properly equipped forge (+)
• Physical Condition: Fatigued from previous work (-)
• Previous Success: Three consecutive successful weapons (-)
• Recipe Complexity: Decorative sword with inlays (-)
• Hard Mode: Active (-)
• Net Assessment: Moderate failure chance (40%)

[Result - Partial Failure]
Hours into the forging process, as you work to hammer the complex pattern into the blade, your fatigued arms cause an uneven strike. The metal, already reaching a critical temperature threshold, deforms slightly along the edge. Though you attempt to correct the error, the blade develops a subtle warp that will affect its balance. The sword will be functional but will never achieve the perfect balance you intended. You could start over at the cost of more materials, or finish this blade knowing it will be of lesser quality than your reputation usually demands.
```

#### 8.5.4 Hard Mode Failure Consequences

In Hard Mode, crafting failures become more punishing and realistic:

- **Increased Material Loss**: 50-100% more materials wasted on failure
- **Tool Degradation**: Tools may wear out or break on critical failures
- **Injury Risk**: Physical harm possible during catastrophic failures
- **Longer Recovery**: More time required to correct mistakes
- **Reputation Impact**: Word of major failures spreads to potential customers
- **Psychological Effects**: Failed crafting attempts may temporarily reduce subsequent crafting checks
- **Workspace Damage**: Serious failures may damage or contaminate the workspace
- **Critical Failure Range**: Natural 1-3 counts as critical failure

#### 8.5.5 Failure as Opportunity

Crafting failures create narrative and gameplay opportunities:

**Learning Through Failure**
- Gain insight into what went wrong
- Unlock new techniques by analyzing mistakes
- Increase skill in specific areas through problem-solving
- Develop deeper material understanding
- Create memory threads of valuable failures

**Material Transformation**

- Mentor intervention to save troubled projects
- Repurposing failed items for alternative uses

**Example Narrative Integration:**
```
Your attempt to create a fine steel sword results in a catastrophic crystallization of the metal during quenching—the blade shatters into dozens of fragments. As you stare at the ruined work, your mentor approaches.

"I've seen this before," she says, examining a fragment. "The ore from the northern mines sometimes has trace elements that require a different approach."

She gathers the fragments and shows you how to melt them down with additional components, creating a distinctive blue-tinted steel alloy that, while unsuitable for swords due to brittleness, proves exceptional for crafting arrowheads that shatter on impact, creating grievous wounds.

This failure becomes the basis for your creation of "Shardsteel," a specialized material that becomes your signature crafting innovation, sought by hunters and warriors throughout the region.

## 11. Gathering & Harvesting Notes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Permits & Ownership**
   - Nobles or guilds may own resource-rich areas, requiring permits to harvest.
   - Trespassing can lead to severe penalties.

2. **Environmental Impact**
   - Overharvesting can damage ecosystems, trigger beast aggression, or spawn corrupted lands.

3. **Monster Harvesting**
   - Requires knowledge of monster biology to extract valuable parts (horns, claws, hearts).
   - Tools or Tamed Beasts (via Beast Taming Magic) can greatly assist in humane or efficient harvesting.

4. **Quality Factors**
   - Some materials degrade quickly if not preserved (e.g., Ifrit glands must be sealed in flame-resistant containers).
   - Thread-Sight can reveal hidden flaws or ensure maximum yields.

5. **Market Variability**
   - Demand rises during wars or crises, making certain materials extremely profitable.
   - Rarity escalates prices, with S-rank items fetching fortunes from collectors or advanced crafters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 12. Crafting Integration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These materials align with the crafting mechanics described in system_crafting.md:

• **Skill Checks**: High-rank materials typically require higher DC checks to process.
• **Quality Tiers**: Rare materials can more easily yield Masterwork or Legendary results.
• **Time Requirements**: Gathering in perilous areas increases overall crafting time.
• **Collaborations**: Specialists in harvesting or taming can help secure top-tier monster drops.

By blending these materials with the existing forging, alchemy, enchanting, and tailoring systems, crafters can push the boundaries of what’s possible in Vantiel—creating legendary arms, armor, and artifacts that shape the world’s destiny.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 13. Conclusion
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this expanded material compendium, adventurers and artisans can plan expeditions, trade routes, and specialized hunts to gather the best resources Vantiel offers. Whether forging B-rank Emberback scales into fireproof shields or venturing into Blighted Zones in hopes of unearthing the legendary Adamantite, every quest ties into the ever-evolving tapestry of crafting and exploration.

Use this reference alongside the bestiary for synergy between material-harvesting from monsters and advanced crafting techniques. As Vantiel’s world changes, the availability and properties of these materials will also shift, ensuring an ongoing journey of discovery for brave crafters and hunters alike.

## 1.0 Overview

In Vantiel, commerce is more than mere transactions—it's a complex web of moral choices, social standing, and character development. Every coin spent, every trade negotiated, and every resource gathered tells a story about your values and place in the world.

### Cognitive Bias, Reflection, and Narrative Drift in Guild Operations

Guild leadership, member interactions, and quest boards are now influenced by advanced narrative and psychological systems:

#### Guild Cognitive Bias & Trauma Table

| Bias/Trauma Example         | How It Affects Guild Decisions/Reflection                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tradition Fixation          | Resists new quest types, slow to adopt reforms                |
| Meritocratic Elitism        | Dismisses low-rank member input, favors "proven" voices       |
| Scandal Trauma              | Overreacts to rumors, suppresses dissent                      |
| Hero Worship                | Ignores flaws in high-rank members, scapegoats outsiders      |
| Factional Paranoia          | Sees conspiracies in routine events, restricts information    |
| Burnout/Disaster Memory     | Avoids high-risk quests, overregulates after past failures    |

*GM/AI should select or roll for a bias/trauma when resolving guild disputes, policy debates, or leadership reflection, especially in times of crisis or change.*

#### Reflection, Memory Fracture, and Narrative Drift

- Leadership and member decisions may be based on incomplete, biased, or fractured memories (e.g., after magical events, trauma, or rumor cascades).
- Reflection on past events can be delayed, incorrect, or emotionally charged, leading to policy reversals, apologies, or schisms.
- Narrative drift: repeated member behaviors, viral rumors, or ideological memes can reshape guild culture, quest board content, or even create cults/factions within the guild.
- Censorship: certain quest types, topics, or member actions may be suppressed, triggering resistance or underground movements.

#### Viral Belief, Censorship, and Addictive Ideology

- Guilds may develop viral beliefs (e.g., "The Guild never abandons its own") that spread through rumor, ritual, or member stories.
- Addictive ideologies can take hold, leading to withdrawal arcs, belief collapse, or enlightenment events (e.g., a "Glory at Any Cost" cult forms, then fractures after a disaster).
- Censorship of certain ideas or quest types can create resistance, secret societies, or alternative quest boards.

#### GM/AI Prompts for Guild Reflection & Drift

When handling guild operations, ask:
1. What cognitive bias or trauma colors this decision or policy?
2. Has memory fracture or rumor drift altered the guild's perception of events?
3. Are viral beliefs or addictive ideologies shaping member behavior or quest selection?
4. Is censorship or resistance emerging in response to new ideas or failures?
5. How does reflection (correct or incorrect) change the outcome of disputes, promotions, or reforms?

These mechanics ensure the Adventurers Guild is a living, evolving organization, capable of both wisdom and folly, and deeply affected by the psychological and narrative forces at play in Vantiel.
