### Companion Trauma, Cognitive Bias, and Memory Fracture Reflection

Companions are not just shaped by their current relationship with the player, but by their own traumas, biases, and the integrity of their memories. These factors can cause companions to reflect on events, dialogue, and relationships in ways that are unpredictable, emotionally charged, or even incorrect.

#### Sample Companion Trauma/Bias Table

| Trauma/Bias Example         | How It Affects Reflection                                      |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Betrayal Trauma            | Sees acts of kindness as manipulation; slow to trust again    |
| Survivor’s Guilt           | Downplays their own achievements; avoids praise               |
| Cultural Prejudice         | Dismisses or misinterprets foreign customs                    |
| Religious Zeal             | Frames events as omens or tests of faith                      |
| Abandonment Issues         | Overreacts to perceived neglect; clings to group              |
| Addictive Belief           | Interprets all events as proof of ideology; resists change    |

*GM/AI should select or a hidden roll for a trauma/bias when a companion is reflecting, especially in emotionally charged or ambiguous situations.*

#### Memory Fracture and Relationship Reflection

When a companion loses or has altered memories (due to magic, trauma, or world events), their ability to reflect on the relationship is degraded:
- Trust, respect, or romance may be reset, lost, or become inconsistent.
- Companions may misremember key events, leading to confusion or conflict.
- Rebuilding trust or intimacy requires not just emotional effort, but the re-establishment of shared memory threads.

#### GM/AI Prompts for Reflection

When handling companion reflection, ask:
1. What trauma or bias colors this companion’s view of the player or event?
2. Has this companion lost or altered any key memories?
3. How might their reflection be incorrect, delayed, or emotionally charged?
4. What relationship dimension (trust, respect, romance, loyalty) is most affected by this?
5. What would it take to repair or deepen the relationship, given these factors?

These mechanics ensure that companion relationships are dynamic, emotionally rich, and can be affected by both internal (trauma, bias) and external (memory loss, magic) forces, creating a more lifelike and narratively complex party dynamic.

## 2. Faction Fundamentals

### 2.1 Faction Structure

All factions in Vantiel share common structural elements, though their specific implementations vary widely:

#### Leadership
- **Singular Leader**: Individual with ultimate authority (monarch, high priest, guildmaster)
- **Ruling Council**: Group of high-ranking members who make decisions collectively
- **Distributed Authority**: Network of semi-autonomous cells or chapters with local leadership

- **Wealth-Based Influence**: Power determined primarily by financial contribution
- **Bloodline Succession**: Leadership and rank inherited through family lines

#### Territory
- **Centralized**: Power concentrated in a single location or region
- **Distributed**: Multiple strongholds or centers of influence
- **Nomadic**: Mobile power base that shifts according to circumstances
- **Virtual**: Influence not tied to physical locations but to networks or concepts

### 2.2 Reputation System

A player's standing with each faction is tracked through a comprehensive reputation system:

#### Reputation Levels
- **Exalted** (90-100): Legendary ally, granted highest privileges and authority
- **Revered** (75-89): Trusted inner circle member with significant influence
- **Honored** (60-74): Respected member with access to special resources
- **Friendly** (45-59): Welcomed ally with basic membership benefits
- **Neutral** (30-44): Neither friend nor foe, standard treatment
- **Suspicious** (15-29): Distrusted outsider, limited interaction
- **Hostile** (1-14): Known enemy, attacked on sight in controlled territories
- **Nemesis** (0): Sworn enemy, actively hunted by faction members

#### Reputation Dimensions
Beyond the simple numerical value, reputation has multiple dimensions:

- **Loyalty**: Perceived dedication to the faction's cause

- **Trustworthiness**: Reliability in keeping promises and secrets
- **Notoriety**: How widely known the player's relationship with the faction is

#### Reputation Decay
Reputation naturally changes over time if not maintained:

- **Critical Incidents**: Some actions create permanent reputation markers that never decay
- **Reputation Memory**: Factions remember particularly significant help or betrayal

Factions in Vantiel maintain complex relationships with one another, ranging from alliance to open warfare:

#### Relationship States

- **Competitive**: Rivalry for resources or influence without direct conflict
- **Hostile**: Active opposition and conflict short of open warfare

#### Relationship Dynamics
These relationships are not static but evolve based on events and circumstances:

- **Shifting Alliances**: Relationships change based on mutual interests and threats
- **Hidden Agendas**: Public relationships may mask secret agreements or hostilities
- **Internal Factions**: Subgroups within organizations may have different relationships

### 8.2 Faction Reflection & Ideological Drift

Factions in Vantiel are not static—they reflect on events, adapt their beliefs, and experience ideological drift over time. This process is shaped by internal debates, leadership reflection, viral beliefs, and the ripple effects of player actions.

#### Faction Reflection Process

- **Initial Response:** Faction leadership or councils react to major events (wars, betrayals, discoveries) based on current doctrine and priorities.
- **Reflection Period:** Over days, weeks, or seasons, internal debates, intelligence reports, and cultural shifts prompt deeper analysis.
- **Ideological Drift:** Core beliefs may evolve, splinter, or radicalize, especially after repeated shocks, viral rumors, or charismatic leaders.
- **Faction Memory:** Significant reflections and ideological shifts are recorded in faction memory threads, influencing future decisions and reputation baselines.

#### GM/AI Prompts for Faction Reflection & Drift

1. What recent event or player action is causing the faction to reflect or debate internally?
2. Which leaders or sub-factions are pushing for change, and which resist?
3. Has a viral belief, rumor, or meme begun to influence the rank-and-file?
4. Is the faction's doctrine drifting toward extremism, moderation, or fragmentation?
5. How does the reflection process affect the player's standing, available quests, or world events?
6. What new policies, rituals, or schisms emerge as a result of this drift?
7. Are there visible signs of ideological conflict (propaganda, protests, purges, reforms)?

#### Example Faction Reflection Memory Thread

```json
{
  "faction_reflection": {
    "faction_id": "radiant_covenant",
    "trigger_event": "Player revealed forbidden magic in public trial",
    "initial_response": "Condemnation and call for inquisition",
    "reflection_process": [
      "Council of Light debates necessity of harsher measures",
      "Younger priests question the wisdom of public executions",
      "Viral rumor spreads that the Goddess herself intervened"
    ],
    "ideological_drift": "Emergence of reformist sub-faction advocating for magical tolerance",
    "outcome": "Temporary schism, new questline for players to mediate or exploit the divide"
  }
}
```

#### Hooks for Player & World Impact

- **Player Actions:** Major deeds (heroism, betrayal, spreading memes) can trigger reflection and drift, opening new opportunities or dangers.
- **Viral Beliefs:** Repeated player behaviors or catchphrases may become faction dogma, slang, or even spark cults.
- **Narrative Drift:** Autonomous world events (plagues, wars, discoveries) can catalyze ideological shifts, even without direct player involvement.
- **Factional Schisms:** Drifting beliefs may split factions, create new organizations, or lead to civil war, with persistent world consequences.

#### Example: Ideological Drift in Action

After the player repeatedly spares defeated enemies and preaches mercy, rumors spread of a "Prophet of Peace." The Radiant Covenant's younger clergy begin to question the doctrine of absolute retribution. Over several in-game months, a reformist movement grows, leading to public debates, secret meetings, and eventually a formal schism. The player is offered quests to support, suppress, or exploit the new movement, and the world responds with new laws, rituals, and conflicts.
